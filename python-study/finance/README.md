## What This Book Covers

This book covers the following topics.

- Profit

You’ll explore the idea of spending money to make money with a timely
motivating example. You will learn about DataFrames, the basics of
loading data in pandas, how to get Python to play nicely with Excel, how to
think about and calculate net present value and internal rate return, and
how to apply functions to data.

- Convert

You’ll learn how to convert currency with Python. You will learn how to
query a third-party API, how to coerce API responses into something
usable, how to manage secrets, how to handle errors, and how to create
Python classes.

- Amortize

You’ll learn how to evaluate a buffet of loan options from different financial
institutions. You will learn about how to calculate fixed-rate payments with
numpy, how to build amortization schedules from scratch, how to build
loops, and how to make those loops ultra-efficient and wicked quick.

- Budget

You’ll explore how to generate a budget that provides day-by-day cash
flow resolution. You will learn how to deal with dates in Python, how to
visualize data, how to use the recurrent library to parse English sentences,
and how to work with the YAML file format.

- Invest

You’ll explore how to build a portfolio rebalancer. You will learn how to
instantiate a portfolio, how to fetch stock quotes, how to update values in a
DataFrame, and how to simulate order processing.

- Spend

This chapter is a bit silly, but it provides a little window into the world of
machine learning with Python and pandas.
