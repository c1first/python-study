# Introduction

Emission factors and emission inventories have long been fundamental 
tools for air quality management. Emission estimates are important 
for developing emission control strategies, determining applicability 
of permitting and control programs, ascertaining the effects of 
sources and appropriate mitigation strategies, and a number of other 
related applications by an array of users, including federal,
state, and local agencies, consultants, and industry. Data from 
source-specific emission tests or continuous emission monitors are 
usually preferred for estimating a source’s emissions because those 
data provide the best representation of the tested source’s 
emissions. However, test data from individual sources are not always 
available and, even then, they may not reflect the variability of 
actual emissions over time. Thus, emission factors are frequently 
the best or only method available for estimating emissions, in spite 
of their limitations.

What Is An AP-42 Emission Factor?

An emission factor is a representative value that attempts to relate the quantity of a pollutant
released to the atmosphere with an activity associated with the release of that pollutant. These factors
are usually expressed as the weight of pollutant divided by a unit weight, volume, distance, or duration
of the activity emitting the pollutant (e. g., kilograms of particulate emitted per megagram of coal
burned). Such factors facilitate estimation of emissions from various sources of air pollution. In most
cases, these factors are simply averages of all available data of acceptable quality, and are generally
assumed to be representative of long-term averages for all facilities in the source category (i. e., a
population average).

The general equation for emission estimation is:

E = A x EF x (1-ER/100)

where:

E = emissions,

A = activity rate,

EF = emission factor, and

ER = overall emission reduction efficiency, %.

ER is further defined as the product of the control device destruction or removal efficiency and the
capture efficiency of the control system. When estimating emissions for a long time period
(e. g., one year), both the device and the capture efficiency terms should account for upset periods as
well as routine operations.

Emission factor ratings in AP-42 (discussed below) provide indications of the robustness, or
appropriateness, of emission factors for estimating average emissions for a source activity. Usually,
data are insufficient to indicate the influence of various process parameters such as temperature and
reactant concentrations. For a few cases, however, such as in estimating emissions from petroleum
storage tanks, this document contains empirical formulae (or emission models) that relate emissions to
variables such as tank diameter, liquid temperature, and wind velocity. Emission factor formulae that
account for the influence of such variables tend to yield more realistic estimates than would factors
that do not consider those parameters.
