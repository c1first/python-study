This Python package, called animals, contains five Python modules: cat, cow,
dog, horse, and sheep. There is also a special file with the rather unusual name
`__init__.py`. This file is called a package initialization file; the presence of this
file tells the Python system that this directory contains a package. The package
initialization file can also be used to initialize the package (hence the name) and can
also be used to make importing the package easier.
